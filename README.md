**FraudGuard AI** is an enterprise-grade financial security system designed to detect, visualize, and neutralize money laundering rings in real-time. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, it utilizes **Graph Theory** to identify circular transaction topologies and **Generative AI** to explain fraud patterns to analysts in plain English.

## 🚀 Top 1% Features

### 🌍 1. Global War Room (Geospatial Intelligence)
- **3D Interactive Map:** Visualizes high-risk transaction clusters using **PyDeck** with a toggle for Satellite Recon Mode.
- **Live Threat Ticker:** A real-time news ticker simulating a banking command center environment.
- **Heatmap Density:** Red hexagonal towers indicate high-frequency fraudulent transaction zones across major global financial hubs (NY, London, Tokyo).

### 🕵️‍♂️ 2. Investigation Room (Graph Forensics)
- **Link Analysis:** Uses **NetworkX** to map the "spiderweb" of money flow between mules.
- **FraudGPT Assistant:** Integrated **GenAI Chatbot** that allows analysts to query the data naturally (e.g., *"Why is Ring #35 suspicious?"*).
- **Suspect Dossier:** Auto-generates suspect profiles including Alias, Device Fingerprint, and IP Address.

### 🔒 3. Enterprise Security & Compliance
- **Blockchain Evidence Hashing:** Every identified suspect is assigned a unique **SHA-256 Hash** to ensure data immutability and chain-of-custody for legal proceedings.
- **PDF Reporting:** One-click generation of law-enforcement-ready evidence reports.
- **Reactive Controls:** "Assets Frozen" KPI updates instantly when an analyst takes action.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### The Workflow
1.  **Ingestion:** Raw transaction data (PaySim) is processed to extract graph features (PageRank, Community Detection).
2.  **Detection:** A Random Forest classifier predicts the probability of fraud based on transaction topology.
3.  **Visualization:** High-risk "Rings" are pushed to the **Streamlit** dashboard for human review.
4.  **Action:** Analysts freeze assets, generating an immutable audit log.

### Tech Stack
-   **Core:** Python 3.11, Pandas, NumPy
-   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest), NetworkX (Graph Algorithms)
-   **Visualization:** Streamlit, Plotly, PyDeck (3D Maps)
-   **Security:** Hashlib (Blockchain Hashing)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10 or 3.11

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aryabhagwat-cloud/Financial-Crime-Risk-Intelligence-Platform.git](https://github.com/aryabhagwat-cloud/Financial-Crime-Risk-Intelligence-Platform.git)
    cd Financial-Crime-Risk-Intelligence-Platform
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you install `pydeck`, `networkx`, and `fpdf`)*

3.  **Data Setup**
    Due to GitHub file size limits, the raw dataset (`raw_paysim.csv`) is not included.
    - Download the dataset from Kaggle (PaySim).
    - Place it inside the `data/` folder.

4.  **Run the Dashboard**
    ```bash
    streamlit run src/dashboard.py
    ```

5.  **Access Credentials**
    - **User:** `Admin`
    - **Pass:** `admin123`

## 📂 Data Engineering & Pipeline

### 1. The Dataset (PaySim Simulation)
The system is trained on the **PaySim** synthetic dataset, generated by a simulator that mimics real-world mobile money transfer network logs. This dataset is the industry standard for financial fraud research because it simulates the exact topology of private banking networks.

* **Source:** Synthetic Mobile Money Transaction Log (derived from real African mobile money service logs).
* **Total Transactions:** 6,362,620 (6.3 Million+ rows).
* **Time Span:** 30 Days (744 simulation steps).
* **Total Volume:** ~$450 Billion (Simulated currency).

### 2. The "Needle in a Haystack" Problem
Real-world fraud is rare, creating a massive **Class Imbalance**.
* **Legitimate Transactions:** 99.87%
* **Fraudulent Transactions:** 0.13% (8,213 cases)
* **Challenge:** Standard models ignore the 0.13%. Our system uses **Graph Neural Network (GNN) features** to amplify the signal of these rare fraud cases without relying solely on oversampling.

### 3. Feature Dictionary
We utilize 11 raw features and engineer 4 complex graph features:

| Feature Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **step** | Unit of time (1 step = 1 hour). |
| **type** | Transaction type (CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER). |
| **amount** | Amount of the transaction in local currency. |
| **nameOrig** | Customer starting the transaction (The Node Source). |
| **oldBalanceOrg** | Initial balance before the transaction. |
| **newBalanceOrig** | New balance after the transaction. |
| **nameDest** | Customer receiving the transaction (The Node Destination). |
| **isFraud** | **Target Variable:** 1 if fraud, 0 if legitimate. |

### 4. Graph Topology Construction
Instead of treating rows independently, we construct a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ where:
* **Vertices ($V$):** Users (Originators and Beneficiaries).
* **Edges ($E$):** Financial transactions weighted by `amount`.

This allows us to detect **"Cycle Attacks"** (A $\rightarrow$ B $\rightarrow$ C $\rightarrow$ A), a pattern typical of money laundering layering phases, which impossible to detect with standard tabular data analysis.
